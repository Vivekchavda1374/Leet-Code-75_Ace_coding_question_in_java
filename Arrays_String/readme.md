# Arrays and String questions:
## Merge Alternately - Solution Explanation
## Problem
We are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. The task is to merge them by alternating characters from each string, starting with the first character of `word1`. If one string is longer than the other, the remaining characters of the longer string should be appended at the end of the merged string.

For example:
- Input: `word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"`
- Output: `"apbqcr"`
